    “The Texas Financial Literacy rate is slowly declining  compared to the US Financial Literacy rates as other states in
        the US such as Minnesota and Wyoming have very high financial literacy rates as they started to improve standards
        on financial education, but Texas has not adapted to the change and has not started prioritizing financial education
        as a result showcasing declining Financial literacy rates.” - Federal Reserve Bank of Texas

        Understanding the concept of utilizing and managing money and taking care of money without going into severe financial debt
        is a  hard task to process among multiple college students. So one of our main project goal is to simplify the understanding
        of all these concepts with the help of charts all around the school showcasing meaningful financial literacy terms in a simple
        manner, and also putting in place in person seminars to create discussion among students to help them gain  a better understanding
        of each financial literacy topic. This will help all students going to college clearly understand how to plan and manage their
        money.
