                        What is Financial Literacy?
                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        Financial literacy is the ability to understand and apply financial concepts such as budgeting, saving, investing, and debt management. It is crucial for young adults because it lays the foundation for financial stability and long-term wealth building. Without financial literacy, individuals may struggle with high-interest debt, live paycheck to paycheck, or fail to save for major life goals such as buying a home or retirement. Understanding financial principles helps individuals avoid common financial pitfalls like excessive credit card debt, payday loans, and impulse spending. In an era of rising living costs and increasing student debt, financial literacy empowers individuals to make informed money decisions, reduce financial stress, and build a secure future.                    </p>

                        Common Financial Challenges for Young Adults                    
                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        Young adults often face financial struggles due to limited income, high student loan debt, and a lack of experience managing money. Budgeting is a common challenge, as many fail to track their spending and end up overspending on non-essential items while neglecting savings. Debt management, especially student loans and credit cards, can be overwhelming due to high-interest charges and long repayment terms. Additionally, young adults often do not fully understand the implications of taxes, insurance, and employer benefits, leading to missed financial opportunities. By recognizing these challenges and learning strategies to manage them, young adults can set themselves up for financial success.

                        Basics of Personal Finance
                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        Personal finance involves managing oneâ€™s financial resources effectively to meet both short-term and long-term goals. It includes understanding key financial components such as income (money earned), expenses (money spent), assets (things you own with financial value), and liabilities (debts or financial obligations). A strong financial foundation requires establishing good habits such as saving regularly, avoiding unnecessary debt, and making informed spending decisions. Learning how to budget effectively, invest wisely, and plan for financial security ensures a stable and prosperous future. Financial planning also prepares individuals for major life events like buying a house, starting a family, or retirement.
