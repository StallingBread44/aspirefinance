                        The snowball method focuses on paying off the smallest debts first, regardless of interest rates. Start by making minimum payments on all debts except the smallest, to which you allocate any extra funds. Once the smallest debt is paid off, roll the amount you were paying into the next smallest debt, creating a "snowball" effect as the payments grow larger. This method provides quick psychological wins, keeping you motivated to continue.

                        The avalanche method prioritizes paying off debts with the highest interest rates first. Make minimum payments on all debts, but direct any extra money toward the debt with the highest rate. Once that debt is eliminated, focus on the next highest-interest debt, saving more money over time by reducing the amount spent on interest. This method is the most cost-efficient but may take longer to see noticeable progress.
