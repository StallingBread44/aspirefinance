                    <p>
                        Banks offer various accounts, including checking, savings, money market, and investment accounts. Each type serves different financial needs. Understanding account features, such as interest rates, fees, and withdrawal limits, helps individuals select the best options.

                    <p>
                        Loans provide financial assistance for large purchases, but they come with repayment obligations and interest. Mortgages are long-term loans for home purchases. Knowing how interest rates, loan terms, and credit scores affect borrowing costs ensures responsible loan management.

                        Investment products include stocks, bonds, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and retirement accounts. Each has varying levels of risk and potential returns. Learning about these options allows individuals to build diversified investment portfolios suited to their goals.
