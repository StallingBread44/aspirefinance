                        Banking basics revolve around understanding how financial institutions help individuals and businesses manage their money. Banks offer essential services such as savings accounts, where money can be stored securely while earning interest, and checking accounts for daily transactions like paying bills or withdrawing cash. They also provide loans for personal, business, or home needs, which are repaid with interest, the cost of borrowing money. Credit cards issued by banks allow users to borrow funds for purchases, with repayment required later, often with interest. Modern banking includes online and mobile services, enabling convenient money transfers, account management, and bill payments. Banks also play a critical role in safeguarding deposits, providing financial advice, and supporting economic growth by lending money to support business operations and personal goals. Understanding these basic functions is essential for effectively managing finances.
