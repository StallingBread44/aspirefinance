                        Taxes are mandatory financial contributions individuals and businesses make to the government to fund public services and infrastructure. They come in various forms, including income tax, which is levied on earnings; sales tax, added to the cost of goods and services; and property tax, assessed on real estate ownership. Corporate taxes are paid by businesses on their profits, while payroll taxes fund programs like Social Security and Medicare. Taxes are vital for maintaining public resources such as schools, hospitals, roads, and law enforcement. They can also be used to influence economic behavior, such as offering tax credits for renewable energy use. Understanding how taxes work helps individuals and businesses plan their finances and comply with legal obligations.
