                        the US such as Minnesota and Wyoming have very high financial literacy rates as they started to improve standards
                        on financial education, but Texas has not adapted to the change and has not started prioritizing financial education

                        Understanding the concept of utilizing and managing money and taking care of money without going into severe financial debt
                        is a  hard task to process among multiple college students. So one of our main project goal is to simplify the understanding
                        of all these concepts with the help of charts all around the school showcasing meaningful financial literacy terms in a simple
                        manner, and also putting in place in person seminars to create discussion among students to help them gain  a better understanding
                        of each financial literacy topic. This will help all students going to college clearly understand how to plan and manage their
                        money.
